## Notes

Shift of focus from blind navigation indoors, to an indoor mapping and location tracking research

## Accomplishments

* New mapping system rotates around bottom of phone instead of top, and map was upside down due to bad matrix algeagra
* Mapping format allows for json defined maps, designed to be easily extended and expanded
* user settings to configure number of steps... Mostly there, bug not fixed
* Heading lock
* Zoom half implemented

## Challenges
* Focus on navigation for blind getting in the way of the research component 
* Pathfinding not yet implemented
* Many tasks from last meeting were hard to do without a real map, so I shifted the priorities to that

## Todo

* Pathfinding
* Positioning
