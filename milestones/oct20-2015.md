## Accomplishments

### Heading tracking

Heading tracking was implemented into the primary android application. 
The Heading class implemented calculated the heading based on the
magnotemeter sensor and the gravity sensors readings.

This was then integrated into the main application view , 
with a simple always-north navigational goal to test the heading tracking of the app

### Updated class diagram

Class diagram has been updated to reflect correct dependencies and
additional dependencies on the gravity sensor and magnetometer

## Challenges

### Android has no built in heading tracking

To my surprise android does not have built in heading tracking,
and no official reference implementation of it. To get the heading both
the gravity(accelerometer) sensor and magnetometer must be used. 

### accuracy of heading tracking needs further testing

I briefly tested the accuracy of my heading tracking implementation, 
it seems semi accurate but needs further investigation to confirm it 
points to magnetic north correctly in in its current state
