## Notes

Shift of focus from blind navigation indoors, to an indoor mapping and location tracking research

## Accomplishments

* Pathfinding fully implemented

## Challenges
* Focus on navigation for blind getting in the way of the research component 
* Pathfinding not yet implemented
* Many tasks from last meeting were hard to do without a real map, so I shifted the priorities to that

## features

* ~~intersection defined in map manually~~
* ~~Pathfinding~~
* Positioning

### extra features

* Blind navigation features
* Map creation interface
* Automatic intersection detection
