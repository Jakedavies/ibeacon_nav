## Accomplishments

* Pathfinding fully implemented

## Implementation

* first the map must define "intersections", these are points where the user would be able to turn to get to a destination or something
* Then we read those intersections in, and map each uniquie x, and y coordinate to a grid of size n x j, where n is the number of unique x coordinates, and j is the number of unique y coordinates
* hash each x, y to a coordinate
* We then taken that grid and increase the bounds from n x j, to 2n-1 x 2j-1
* every odd n and j, we create a coordinate in between n-1 and n+1
* if the space between the odd n and j is occupied from n-1 to n+1 and from j-1 to j + 1, we mark this new point as not walkable, this is our ray tracing inspired grid building
* an A* search is run on the resulting to 2n-1 x 2j-1 grid, and the coordinates are converted back to their true x,y values, and written out as rectangles
