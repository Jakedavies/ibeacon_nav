# Febuary 18th


## Accomplishments

* Testing of trilateration algorithm
* Better map
* Notifications near IBeacons
* Better 

## Not accomplished

* improving direction estimates using ibeacon with heading sensor
* Subsections

## Results of testing trilateration

* measurements are wildly innacurate
* in a 4 meter x 4 meter room, with no obstructions measurements vary +- 3 meters

### Results of trilateration testing, 5 meter by 5 meter room, beacons at (0,0), (0,4), (4, 2) 

```
In center of room (2, 2) (flat)
| Second | X | Y |
|--------|---|---|
| 1 | 3.5 | 3.6 |
| 2 | -0.5 | 4.6 |
| 3 | 1.0 | 4.6 |
| 4 | 2.3 | 3.6 |
| 5 | 3.2 | 4.9 |
| 6 | -4.4 | 5.5 |
| 7 | 1.9 | 3.8 | 
| 8 | 1.0 | 4.6 |
| 9 | 2.3 | 3.6 |
| 10 | -0.5 | 4.6 | 

In center of room (2, 2) (Standing up)

| Second | X | Y |
|--------|---|---|
| 1 | 5.7 | 3.6 |
| 2 | 6.6 | 4.4 |
| 3 | 4.4 | 2.3 |
| 4 | 5.7 | 3.6 |
| 5 | 5.1 | -1.5 |
| 6 | 4.6 | 2.8 |
| 7 | 4.9 | 3.1 | 
| 8 | 4.9 | 3.1 |
| 9 | 4.8 | -1.2 |
| 10 | 4.5 | 2.9 | 

```

```
Outside of room (6, 2) (flat)

```

```
Very close to a beacon (0,0) (flat)

```

All tests were conducted with the device placed on a table unobscured with a clear LOS to the beacons.
