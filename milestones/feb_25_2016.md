# Febuary 18th


## Accomplishments

* Testing of trilateration algorithm
* Better map
* Notifications near IBeacons
* Better 

## Not accomplished

* improving direction estimates using ibeacon with heading sensor
* Subsections

## Results of testing trilateration

* measurements are wildly innacurate
