# Febuary 18th


## Accomplishments

* Testing of trilateration algorithm
* Better map
* Notifications near IBeacons
* Better 

## Not accomplished

* improving direction estimates using ibeacon with heading sensor
* Subsections

## Results of testing trilateration

* measurements are wildly innacurate
* in a 4 meter x 4 meter room, with no obstructions measurements vary +- 3 meters

### Results of trilateration testing, 5 meter by 5 meter room, beacons at (0,0), (0,4), (4, 2) 

```
In center of room (2, 2) (flat)


In center of room (2, 2) (Standing up)

```

```
Outside of room (6, 2) (flat)

```

```
Very close to a beacon (0,0) (flat)

```

All tests were conducted with the device placed on a table unobscured with a clear LOS to the beacons.
