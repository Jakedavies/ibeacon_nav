## Accomplishments

* Map loading from resources dynamically
* Sections loaded from maps dynamically
* intersections can be defined as a goal, and named. The name is what displays in the UI as a section
* Ability to change destination added
* Can switch destination section while navigating and path will be recalcuated
* Modified the map to accept a different user location and update ui

## Not so accomplished

* Time spent making triangulation work, got frustrated with writing the trialateration algothim, tried to use a package https://github.com/lemmingapex/Trilateration but am bad at java
* User location coming from the sensor currently hard coded until I can get triangulation working
