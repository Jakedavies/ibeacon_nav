many testings of accuracy for ibeacons

testing of trilateration method on phone, works as expected except x and y is swapped, will ignore for now..


## deliverables

* Results of testings
* New android activity created that is condusive to testing ibeacon data
* More tests written against triangulation algorithm, determined results x and y are flipped.. but other than that results are +- 0.5 

## Next week

* Testing of different devices
* Hand calculations of ibeacon triangulation using 3 - 6 beacons
*
