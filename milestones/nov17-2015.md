## Accomplishments

### None :(


## Challenges

### Map pivoting is hard

Some approaches taken to pivoting the map did not work, I tried to create a map as a series of Rectangle objects, inside of a floorplan class that defined a floorplan size and width. This proved to be very hard and the matrix transformations required to zoom and pivot the map were far mathier than I had planned


## For next week

Abdallah suggested a new approach of a 2 dimensional array of booleans that define the map, and we display the booleans that can be seen by the phone appropriately. I think this approach will be easier to implement and build on that the previously tried approach. To extend this instead of a 2d boolean array, we could make it a byte array, giving us 8 possible configuration options for different object types on the map.
