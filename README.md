# An research project in indoor navigation using IBeacon technology, with a focus on the blind or partially sighted

## Requirements
* Android application
  * Indoor location tracking using iBeacon 
    * Proximity based tracking based on single iBeacon proxmity
    * Full 2d tracking based on triangulation of >= 3 iBeacons
  * Sight impaired navigation (Haptic or Audio based)
  * Sight impaired friendly UI navigation 
    * Menu to select a location, (IE. Lakeview Market, Orchard Park Mall)
    * Menu to select a section in said location, (IE. Product section, Food Court)
  
* Server side application to define locations and upload new locations 
  * Hosts locations for android application to download
  * Ability to upload/define new loctations 
  * 


## Todo (In order or importance)
1. Basic android app that interfaces with the IBeacon
2. Add menus of locations to app
3. Heading and directional tracking (IE, N-S-E-W) in order to give turn based Navigation
4. Navigational feedback for a user from the app (Haptic or voice)
5. Basic location tracking using IBeacon (Simple proximity based tracking)
6. Location triangulation using IBeacon (More exact proximity based tracking)
7. Server/client communication between mobile device and server for configuration data and additional tracking information
8. Pinpoint navigation of sections in a store (Lakeview market test)
